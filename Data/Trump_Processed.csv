1773,i hate to say it but the republican convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the democratic convention
1774,no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible highly overated

1781,dems do nt want to talk isis bc hilary foreign interventions unleashed isis  her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here
1782,bernie exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed
1783,the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hilary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar

1789,funy if you listen to  the democrats did not have a good day if you listen to the other two they are fawning what a difference
1790,bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hilary clinton all of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it waste of time
1791,elizabeth waren often referred to as pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hilary who she always hated
1792,sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs
1793,if cory booker is the future of the democratic party they have no future i know more about cory than he knows about himself
1794,i was at  and met juan wiliams in passing he asked if he could have pictures taken with me i said fine he then trashes on air
1795,hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold he got nothing for all of the time energy and money the vp a joke
1796,while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers
1797,clinton betrayed bernie voters kaine supports tp is in pocket of wall stret and backed iraq war
1798,thank you ohio trumpence16

1801,makeamericagreatagain
1802,great poll numbers are coming out all over people do nt want another four years of obama and crooked hilary would be even worse maga
1803,the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hilary clinton and debie waserman schultz that they will vote for change
1804,wow the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess but fear not the dishonest media will find a good spin
1805,here we go again with another clinton scandal and emails yet can you believe crooked hilary knew the fix was in b never had a chance
1806,crooked hilary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc  they just got caught that al they laughed at bernie
1807,if bernie sanders after seeing the just released emails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same
1808,thank you makeamericagreatagain
1809,hilary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have hapened
1810,how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb emails using even religion against bernie
1811,the new joke in town is that rusia leaked the disastrous dnc emails which should never have been written stupid because putin likes me
1812,watched crooked hilary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes no way they are going to fix america problems isis  all others laughing
1813,the ratings for the republican national convention were very god but for the final night my spech great thank you
1814,the highly neurotic debie waserman schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hilary victory she out
1815,the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing emails say the rigged system is alive  wel
1816,even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength i do nt believe that his supporters will let crooked hilary off the hok
1817,crooked hilary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top dws too bad bernie flamed out
1818,if the republican convention had blown up with emails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player bernie media would go wild
1819,the  panels are so one sided almost all against trump  is so much better and the ratings are much higher do nt watch cn
1820,i always said that debie waserman schultz was overrated the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted no energy left
1821,today proves what i have always known that  priebus is the tough one and the smart one not debie waserman shultz
1822,sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just ca nt go on any longer he is trying to dismiss the new emails and dnc disrespect sad
1823,there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end
1824,an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates
1825,looks like the bernie people will fight if not their blod sweat and tears was a total waste of time kaine stands for oposite
1826,wow president obama brother malik just announced that he is voting for me was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else
1827,bernie sanders started off strong but with the selection of kaine for vp is ending really weak so much for a movement total disrespect
1828,the crooked hilary vp choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters just another case of bad judgement by h
1829,makeamericagreatagain trumpence16

1835,i will bring jobs back and get wages up people have nt had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs
1836,tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job kiler
1837,funny that the democrats would have their convention in pensylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back
1838,crooked hilary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pensylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta
1839,leaked emails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders mock his heritage and much more online from wikileakes really vicious rigged
1840,pocahontas wanted vp slot so badly but was nt chosen because she has done nothing in the senate also crooked hilary hates her
1841,tim kaine is and always has ben owned by the banks bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice bernie fought for nothing
1842,the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for phily fight

4489,face it trey gowdy failed miserably on benghazi he allowed it to drag out and in the end let hilary get away with murder
4490,max andreajmarkley rubio finally gets an endorsement – from benghazi loser gowdy tcot pjnet via dailyne

7451,it was only after i informed nbc that i would nt do the apprentice that they became upset w me they couldn’t care less about “inclusion
7452,i agree 10 mcain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our vets
7453,2     rest of gop only cries but trump gets stuff done
7454,the left is petrified of you why else would they be attacking you so vigorously
7455,trump already hosts vets at his resorts what does hilary do
7456,trump says things that no one else would even consider saying i agree with him on the immigration situation i love honesty
7457,eod i believe we have passed that point there are homeless veterans in usa  yet illegal aliens get government housing
7458,hosts events around the usa 4our veterans long before a presidential run he loves our military
7459,this is big criticism of the republican field speak truth and stop being so pc this is why  resonates
7460,at least we re talking about the va we were nt a month ago
7461,we will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans
7462,the ever dwindling  which is worth about 110 of what it was purchased for is always hitting me politically who cares

7483,a true piece about the standing ovations i got yesterday
7484,the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly john mcain has done nothing to help them but talk
7485,john mcain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix he owes apology
7486,79  why do they attack mr trump because he has something they dont the ability of truth trump is here
7487,cheri  mr trump the only one telling the truth liberals ca nt stand the fact that your are leading in the pol
7488,kick there ass trump
7489,im on the trumptrain2016
7490,because she shoots straight like you do mr trump no bulsht just truth factcheck quithatin
7491,wow  just wrote the definitive piece on what i said about john mcain
7492,one of the reasons i am no fan of john mcain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians i will fix va quickly
7493,via  “donald trump john mcain is ‘a loser’”
7494,why would anybody listen to  he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama by the wayso did john mcain
7495,congrats to the new gov of texas tx for taking a tough  bold stance at the border should have been done long ago by pery
7496,i have a proven track record supporting our veterans veterans deserve universal access to care va scandal proves politicians are inept
7497,that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care
7498,it a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans
7499,i will make this right for our great vets
7500,all he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything
7501,john mcain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives
7502,the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years
7503,captured or not all our soldiers are heroes
7504,in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets john mcain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president
7505,just left family leadership summit in iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people i will be back soon

22852,this assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of  and  celebaprentice
22853,george ros could be right— would be better in the adventure task than the romance task celebaprentice
22854,isn’t excited about their ideas are you celebaprentice
22855,is making no attempt to help is he in buseyland their team is short on help already… celebaprentice

22879,did nt the boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away we are not dealing with an innocent baby heredeath
22880,when the stupid people start feeling sorry for the boston killer and want to release him and give him medals remember the kilingsmaimings
22881,i hate when the news media so afraid to offend anyone always refers to the boston killer as the suspect

24477,so far he has been a complete failure at doing so he should read the art of the deal and use his energy to focus on a new career
24478,the media is so in the tank for obama that it is amazing—the funny thing is he can’t stand them
24479,speaker john boehner who i like should never have agreed to raise taxes because the republicans got absolutely nothing for it
24480,almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool
